# Motivation

The emerging field of Data Science is driven by research which lies at the nexus of Statistics and Computer Science. Bioacoustics is one such area generating vast quantities of data, often through citizen science initiatives [@pettorelli2013indicator]. Bioacoustic techniques for biodiversity monitoring [@stathopoulos2017bat] [@damoulas2010bayesian] have the potential to make real policy impacts, particularly with regard to sustainable economic development and nature conservation.

Bats (order *Chiroptera*) have been identified as ideal bioindicators for monitoring climate change and habitat quality [@jones2009carpe], and are of particular interest for monitoring biodiversity acoustically. Typically, a bat broadcasts information about itself in an ultrasonic echolocation call [@griffin1944echolocation]. The development of automatic acoustic monitoring algorithms [@stathopoulos2017bat] [@walters2012continental] means that large scale, non-invasive monitoring of bats is becoming possible.   

Monitoring bat populations provides useful information, but an understanding of the evolutionary history is required to identify the cause and effect of any changes observed. The echolocation call structure, which reflects a bats diet and habitat [@aldridge1987morphology], is a key aspect of this evolutionary history. Reconstructing ancestral traits [@joy2016ancestral] relies on a statistical comparative analysis incorporating extant species and fossil records [@felsenstein2004inferring]. However, the fossil record is of limited use in inferring ancestral echolocation calls in bats. Therefore, statistical data science techniques may shed some light on this topic.

Previous studies of bat echolocation calls for both classification [@walters2012continental] and ancestral reconstruction [@collen2012evolution] analysed features extracted from the call spectrogram. These call features relied upon domain knowledge to ensure they were sensibly selected and applied. More recently, general techniques for the classification of acoustic signals have been developed [@stathopoulos2017bat] [@damoulas2010bayesian]. General techniques for the ancestral reconstruction of function-valued traits have also been proposed [@group2012phylogenetic]. @jones2013evolutionary extend Gaussian Process Regression [@rasmussen2006gaussian] to model the evolution of function-valued traits [@meyer2005up] over a phylogeny, a method which was demonstrated for synthetic data by @hadjipantelis2013function. This current research investigates these techniques in the context of the bat echolocation calls.

# Methods

## Phylogenetic Gaussian Processes

A Gaussian process places a prior distribution over functions, \(f(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k (x, x'))\), where \(x \in \mathbf{R}^P\) is some input variable, the mean function \(m(x) = \mathbf{E}[f(x)]\), and the covariance function \(k(x, x') = \mathrm{cov}(f(x), f(x') )\). Given observations \(\mathbf{y}\) at locations \(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^N\), Gaussian noise, and kernel hyperparameters \(\theta\), a posterior predictive distribution over functions can be inferred analytically. See @rasmussen2006gaussian for an in depth treatment.   

@jones2013evolutionary extend GPs for the inference of function-valued traits over a phylogeny. Consider \(\mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\), a functional representation of the echolocation call of the species observed at the point \(\mathbf{t}\) on the phylogenetic tree \(\mathbf{T}\) with respect to frequency. Modelling this as GP function, where \(\mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{t}}(f)\) corresponds to a point \((f, \mathbf{t})\) on the frequency-phylogeny \(F \times \mathbf{T}\), requires that a suitable phylogenetic covariance function, \(\Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}\left((f,\mathbf{t}), (f',\mathbf{t}')\right)\), is defined.

Deriving a tractable form of the phylogenetic covariance function requires some simplifying assumptions. Firstly, it is assumed that conditional on their common ancestors in the phylogenetic tree \(\mathbf{T}\), any two traits are statistically independent. 

The second assumption is that the statistical relationship between a trait and any of it's descendants in \(\mathbf{T}\) is independent of the topology of \(\mathbf{T}\). That is to say that the underlying process driving evolutionary changes is identical along all individual branches of the tree. We call this underlying process along each branch the marginal process. The marginal process depends on the date of \(\mathbf{t}\), the distance between \(\mathbf{t}\) and the root of \(\mathbf{T}\), denoted \(t\). 

Finally, it is assumed that the covariance function of the marginal process is separable over evolutionary time and the function-valued trait space. Thus, by defining the frequency only covariance function \(K(f,f')\) and the time only covariance function \(k(t,t')\) the covariance function of the marginal process is \(\Sigma\left((f,t), (f',t')\right) = K(f, f') k(t,t')\).

Under these conditions the phylogenetic covariance function is also separable and so
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}\left((f,\mathbf{t}), (f',\mathbf{t}')\right) = K(f, f') k_{\mathbf{T}}(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{t}').
(\#eqn:phy)
\end{equation}

For a phylogenetic Gaussian Process \(Y\) with covariance function given by \@ref(eqn:phy), when \(K\) is a degenerate Mercer kernel, there exists a set of \(n\) deterministic basis functions \(\phi_i: F \to \mathbf{R}\) and univariate GPs \(X_i\) for \(i = 1,\dots, n\) such that 
\[
g(f, \mathbf{t}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \phi_i(f) X_i(\mathbf{t})
\] 
has the same distribution as \(Y\). The full phylogenetic covariance function of this phylogenetic GP is
\[
\Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}((f, \mathbf{t}), (f', \mathbf{t}')) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  k_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}') \phi_i(f) \phi_i(f'),
\]
where \(\int \phi_i(f) \phi_j(f) df = \delta_{ij}\), \(\delta\) being the Kronecker delta, and so the phylogenetic covariance function depends only on \(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}' \in \mathbf{T}\). 

Thus, given function-valued traits observed at \(\mathbf{f} \times \mathcal{t}\) on the frequency-phylogeny, where \(\mathbf{f} = [f_1, \dots, f_q]^{\mathsf{T}}\) and \(\mathcal{t} = [\mathbf{t}_1, \dots, \mathbf{t}_Q]^{\mathbf{T}}\), an appropriate set of basis functions \(\phi_{F} = [\phi^{F}_1(\mathbf{f}), \dots, \phi^{F}_n(\mathbf{f})]\) for the traits \(\mathcal{E} = [\mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{t}}(\mathbf{f}), \dots, \mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{t}'}(\mathbf{f})]\), and Gaussian Processes, \(X_{\mathbf{T}} = [X_1^{\mathbf{T}}(\mathcal{t}), \dots\ X_n^{\mathbf{T}}(\mathcal{t})]\), the set of observations of the echolocation function-valued trait are then 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E} = X_{\mathbf{T}} \phi_F^{\mathsf{T}}.
\label{eqn:inv}
\end{equation}

The problem of obtaining estimators \(\hat{\phi}_F\) and \(\hat{X}_{\mathbf{T}}\) is dealt with by Hajipantelis \textit{et al.} [@hadjipantelis2013function]. \(\hat{\phi}_F\) is obtained by Independent Components Analysis, as described by Blaschke \& Wiscott [@blaschke2004cubica] after using a resampling procedure to obtain stable principal components for the observed traits. Given \(\hat{\phi}_F\), the estimated matrix of mixing coefficients is \(\hat{X}_{\mathbf{T}} = \mathcal{E} (\hat{\phi}_F^{\mathsf{T}})^{-1}\).

\end{figure}

Each column of \(X_{\mathbf{T}}\) is an independent, univariate, phylogenetic GP, \(X_i^{\mathbf{T}}(\mathcal{t})\), modelled here with phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process kernel.

The phylogenetic OU process is defined by the kernel
\begin{equation}
k_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}') = (\sigma_p^i)^2 \exp \left( \frac{-d_{\mathbf{T}}(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}')}{\ell^i} \right) + (\sigma_n^i)^2 \delta_{\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}'}
\label{eqn:oukernel}
\end{equation}

where \(\delta\) is the Kronecker delta, \(d_{\mathbf{T}}(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}')\) is the distance along \(\mathbf{T}\) between \(\mathbf{t}\) and \(\mathbf{t}' \in \mathbf{T}\), and \(\mathbf{\theta}^i = [\sigma_p^i, \ell^i, \sigma_n^i]^{\mathsf{T}}\) is the vector of hyperparameters for \(X_i^{\mathbf{T}}(\cdot)\). The phylogenetic covariance matrix for \(X_i^{\mathbf{T}}(\mathcal{t})\) is denoted \(\Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathcal{t}, \mathcal{t})\) and the marginal likelihood of the observed data given \(\theta\) is
\begin{equation}
\log(p(\mathcal{E} | \theta)) \propto -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left( X_i(\mathcal{t})^{\mathsf{T}} \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathcal{t}, \mathcal{t})^{-1}  X_i(\mathcal{t}) + \log |\Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathcal{t}, \mathcal{t})|    \right)
\label{eqn:t2mle}
\end{equation}
and so \(\theta\) can be estimated by type II maximum likelihood estimation.

Ancestral Reconstruction of the function valued trait for the species at \(\mathbf{t}^*\) then amounts to inferring the posterior predictive distribution \(p(\mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{t}^*} (\cdot) | \mathcal{E}) \sim \mathcal{N}(A, B)\) where 
\begin{equation}
A = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathbf{t}^*, \mathcal{t}) \left( \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathcal{t}, \mathcal{t})
\right)^{-1} X_i^{\mathcal{E}} (\mathcal{t}) \phi_i(\cdot) \right)
\label{eqn:postmean}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathbf{t}^*, \mathbf{t}^*) -  \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathbf{t}^*, \mathcal{t}) \left( \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathcal{t}, \mathcal{t})
\right)^{-1} \Sigma_{\mathbf{T}}^i(\mathbf{t}^*, \mathcal{t})^{\mathsf{T}} \right) \phi_i (\cdot)
\label{eqn:postvar}
\end{equation}

We note that the elements of \(\theta\) each have intuitive interpretations. The total variation of observed points is \(\sigma_p + \sigma_n\), where \(\sigma_p\) is the phylogenetic noise, and \(\sigma_n\) is the non-phylogenetic noise. \(\sigma_p\) is the variation depending on the evolutionary time between any \(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}' \in \mathbf{T}\), while \(\sigma_n\) accounts for variation that does not depend on the phylogeny. The length-scale parameter, \(\ell\), indicates the strength of the correlation between points on \(\mathbf{T}\), where large values of \(\ell\) indicate a correlation that decays slowly as \(d_{\mathbf{T}}(\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{t}')\) increases. 

## Echolocation Calls as Function-Valued Traits

A functional data object is generated when repeated measurements of some process are taken along a continuous scale, such as time [@ramsay2006functional]. 
These measurements can be thought of as representing points on a curve that varies gradually and continuously. In the context of phylogenetics, these functional data objects are function-valued traits [@meyer2005up].

Given a phylogenetic tree \(\mathbf{T}\), representing the evolutionary relationships between the recorded bat species, we denote the \(m^{th}\) call recording of the \(l^{th}\) individual bat of the species observed at point \(\mathbf{t} \in \mathbf{T}\) by \(\{\hat{x}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(n)\}_{n=0}^{N_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}} - 1}\). 
Thus, \(\{\hat{x}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(n)\}\) is a series of discrete measurements of the function \(x_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\), observed at the time points given by \(\frac{n}{f_S}\), where \(f_S\) is the sampling rate, in samples per second (Hz), of the recording. Assume then that \(x_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) = x_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) + z_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\), where \(x_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is the representative call function for the \(l^{th}\) individual and \(z_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is the noise process for the \(m^{th}\) call. Further, assume that \(x_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) = x^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) + z_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) where \(x^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is the representative call function for the bat species at \({\mathbf{t}}\) and \(z_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is the noise process for the \(l^{th}\) individual. It is the phylogenetic relationship between the species level echolocation call functions that we are interested in modelling.

The call recordings themselves are functional data objects, however modelling the phylogenetic relationships between \(\{x_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(t)\}\) and \(\{x_{l'm'}^{{\mathbf{t}}'}(t)\}\) directly implies that the processes are comparable at time \(t\). 
This is not the case for acoustic signals, a phenomenon which is often addressed by dynamic time warping [@berndt1994using]. Another approach to this issue is to consider an alternative functional representation of the signal. 

The Fourier transform of \(x_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is given by
\[
X_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(t) e^{-i 2\pi f t} dt.
\label{eqn:dft}
\]
The energy spectral density of \(x_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform and the log energy spectral density is given by
\[
\mathcal{E}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) = 10 \log_{10} \left( |X_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)|^2 \right).
\]

Similarly to the call functions, \(\mathcal{E}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) is the log energy spectral density of the \(m^{th}\) call of the \(l^{th}\) individual from the species at \({\mathbf{t}}\) where \(\mathcal{E}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) = \mathcal{E}_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) + \mathcal{Z}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) and \(\mathcal{E}_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) = \mathcal{E}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot) + \mathcal{Z}_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) where \(\mathcal{Z}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{l}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\) are noise processes, each with an expected value of zero.  The log energy spectral density is a periodic function of frequency which describes the energy of a signal at each frequency on the interval \(F = [0, \frac{f_S}{2}]\).[@antoniou2006digital]

The discrete Fourier Transform [@antoniou2006digital]
of \(\{\hat{x}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(n)\}\) provides an estimate for the log energy spectral density, the positive frequencies of which are denoted \(\{\mathcal{E}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(k) : k = 0, \dots, \frac{ N_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}}{2} + 1\}\). Smoothing splines [@friedman2001elements] are applied to this series to obtain \(\hat{\mathcal{E}}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\), a smooth function estimating \(\mathcal{E}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(\cdot)\).

We now have a functional representation of each bats echolocation call where the pairs of observations \(\{f, \hat{\mathcal{E}}_{lm}^{\mathbf{t}}(f)\}\) and \(\{f, \hat{\mathcal{E}}_{l'm'}^{{\mathbf{t}}'}(f)\}\) are directly comparable. These function-valued traits can now be modelled for evolutionary inference.
