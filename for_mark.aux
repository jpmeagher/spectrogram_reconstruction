The smooth surface is obtained by taking the call spectrogram and treating it as a functional data object. The spectrogram is first smoothed by a robust 2-D spline smoother, then mapped to an absolute time scale and registered in time by a pairwise surface synchronisation, and finally restricted to the 9 - 212 kHz frequency spectrum.}}{2}{figure.1}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces A Graphical model detailing the structure of the model for evolution used to produce reconstructions of ancestral bat echolocation calls. Let \(y_n\) be a random variable representing an echolocation call recording. \(S_n\) is the random variable representing the smoothed spectrogram surface given by \(y_n\). The Mexican bat call dataset provides \(N = 1816\) observations of these random variables. The process of transforming a call recording into a spectrogram surface was covered in my 9 month report. The model assumes that each \(S_n\) can be modelled by \(Q\) independent deterministic 'evolutionary features' denoted \(\phi _q\). In this case \(\phi _q\) is inferred by a Principal Components Analysis of \(\{S_n\}_{n = 1}^N\). The weight of each evolutionary feature in \(S_n\) is itself a random variable, where \(w_{nq}\) denotes the weight of \(\phi _q\) in \(S_n\). \(w_{nq}\) is assumed to behave as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian process for which the input space is the phylogeny \(\mathcal  {P}\). Each Gaussian process is defined by the deterministic hyperparameters \(\theta _q = [\gamma _q, \ell _q, \sigma _q]^\mathsf  {T}\) which are inferred from the data by Type II maximum likelihood estimation over the observed weights. The phylogeny \(\mathcal  {P}\) is also assumed to be deterministic in this model and is shown in Figure 2. Ancestral reconstruction is performed by making a prediction for the feature weights, denoted \(\mathaccentV {hat}05E{w}\), at some point on \(\mathcal  {P}\). Applying these weights to the evolutionary features produces the ancestral call surface which in turn provides an estimate for the ancestral call.}}{5}{figure.4}}

This model includes a noise process over the call surface, which would allow the calculation of the model evidence.
